# AIR-BAG-PHONE-CASE
We already have several case options in the market that can protect mobile devices from harm, such as cracks, scraps, water damage, and more. But usually, they come at a price apart from adding more bulk to the handsets that we have to carry around in our pockets. But a solution called AD (active damping) phone case, which has been registered for a patent, can detect when your handset is in a free fall. It then releases springs to make the phone bounces on the surface, damping the impact.
Air bag phone cases are a type of protective phone case that incorporates air cushion technology to enhance the level of protection for your smartphone. Here are four points about air bag phone cases:
  Shock Absorption: Air bag phone cases are designed to provide excellent shock absorption. The cases typically feature air-filled pockets or cushions at the corners and edges, which absorb and disperse impact energy in the event of a drop or impact. This helps reduce the risk of damage to your phone, especially to vulnerable areas like the corners and edges.
  Slim Design: Despite their advanced shock-absorbing capabilities, air bag phone cases often maintain a relatively slim and lightweight design. This makes them a popular choice for those who want reliable protection without adding excessive bulk to their smartphones. The slim profile ensures that the phone remains easy to handle and fits comfortably in pockets or bags.
    Responsive Buttons and Ports: Quality air bag phone cases are designed with precise cutouts for buttons, ports, and features, ensuring easy access and functionality. The cases maintain responsiveness for tactile buttons and do not interfere with the phone's ports, speakers, or camera. This allows users to continue using their phones seamlessly without compromising on convenience or usability.
